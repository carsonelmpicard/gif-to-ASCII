# gif-to-ASCII
 A way to create a set of ASCII text files into an HTML animation.

I created this by finding a gif I wanted to convert and then exported each frame as a PNG using Photoshop. I then used an ASCII generator (https://ascii-generator.site/) was the one I used but any would work. I then copied the raw text and saved each frame as "frame1.txt" and so on in the frames folder.

You will need to run on a local server.

P.S. This is my First time publishing one of these, so I apologize if the syntax is informal/incorrect. Regardless you should be able to view my example and figure it out. Good luck!
